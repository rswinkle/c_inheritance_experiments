c_inheritance_experiments
=========================

I never use inheritance or polymorphism in my own code (even my C++ code),
and almost never even have a reason to think about using it to solve a problem
(there's almost always a better, cleaner way).  However, I recently came across
this really old reddit comment:

As an interesting exercise I figured I'd play around with his method and in the
unlikely event I ever want to use C++ style inheritance in C (or any kind of
inheritance really), I'll have this as an option.  The only think I can think of
using it for is porting others' inheritance based C++ code to C without having to
completely redesign it.  We'll see how it goes.
